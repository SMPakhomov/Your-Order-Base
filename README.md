# Your-Order-Base

ABOUT
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Your-Order-Base is a pet project that can help us get rid of unnecessary information. You may not remember when your order will arrive, where it will be delivered, in which marketplace you ordered, etc., this project will do everything for you. In order to keep the information about your orders up to date, the possibility of administering orders has been implemented. Have a question about an order? You can write to the support section and we will receive your appeal, and you will have to wait for a response to your mail.

PAY ATTENTION
_________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
When registering accounts in some mailboxes, for example in @mail.ru, problems arise at the verification stage by the code from the mail, due to their anti-spam systems. Unfortunately, we cannot influence this situation in any way. I also want to draw attention to the fact that so far the database is stored locally by the user. In the foreseeable future, I plan to implement cloud storage of the database and access to it and its changes in real time.
